# Maintenance

**Maintenance costs** are resource expenses that must be paid as long as the corresponding element is active. These costs are specified as per hour. Maintenance costs are subtracted from income to generate a balance, which reflects the net resource income per hour.

Some elements requiring maintenance costs include:  
- **Population** (food)  
- **Military units** (food, gold, and in some cases, villagers)  
- **Armies** (gold)  
- **Samurai** (gold)  
- Maintaining **ninjas** on espionage missions (gold)  
- Certain active **political actions**  

Additionally, **watchtowers**, **the castle**, and **escorts assigned to samurai** have associated maintenance costs in gold.  

:::warning
If maintenance costs exceed income, your stored resources will begin to deplete. If your gold and food resources reach zero and the balance remains negative, you will start losing military units and population until the balance becomes positive.

You can check whether your income and expenses balance is positive or negative by hovering over the resource box. Furthermore, the number indicating your stored resources will turn **green** if the balance is positive and **red** if it is negative.
