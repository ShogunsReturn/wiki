- Special Effect

<Admonition type="tip" title="Special Effect – Strategic Leadership">
  <ul>
    <li>Each Warlord increases the damage of all friendly units by:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><code>+0.5 + 0.05 × (level - 1)</code> per unit</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Each Warlord affects up to 100 units (including himself).</li>
    <li>Maximum bonus is capped at <code>5 + (level - 1)</code>.</li>
    <li>If a Warlord is present in an allied army, their bonus applies to associated armies as well, provided there is at least one Warlord per army.</li>
    <li>Does not affect summoned animals.</li>
    <li>If Warlords, Ashihei Captains, or Tacticians of different levels are present, their levels are averaged (rounded down).</li>
  </ul>
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Scaling Considerations">
  <ul>
    <li>If the total units exceed the number covered by Warlords (<code>Warlords × 100</code>), the bonus is divided accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>990 units and 10 Warlords = <strong>+2.5</strong> bonus</li>
        <li>1000 units and 20 Warlords = <strong>+5</strong> bonus (full)</li>
        <li>If an army has twice the number of units needed, the bonus is halved</li>
      </ul>
    <li>If Warlords, Ashihei Captains, or Tacticians of different levels are present in the same army, their <strong>average level is used (rounded down)</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Examples">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>990 Units and 10 Warlords</strong>: +5 bonus (meets ratio)</li>
    <li><strong>1980 Units and 20 Warlords</strong>: +5 bonus (capped)</li>
    <li><strong>1990 Units and 10 Warlords</strong>: +2.5 bonus (insufficient coverage)</li>
    <li><strong>99 Units and 1 Warlord</strong>: +0.5 bonus</li>
    <li><strong>98 Units and 2 Warlords</strong>: still +0.5 bonus (only 1 needed)</li>
    <li><strong>495 Units and 5 Warlords</strong>: +2.5 bonus</li>
    <li><strong>490 Units and 10 Warlords</strong>: still +2.5 (excess doesn't help)</li>
  </ul>
