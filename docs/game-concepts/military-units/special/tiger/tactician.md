### Trait
- Special Effect

:::tip Special Effect - Master of War
- Enhances all units that have a natural bonus against specific enemies, granting an additional damage boost.
- Functions similarly to Ashigaru Leaders or Generals.
- Applies to units in allied or attached armies, as long as at least one Strategist is present among their ranks.

**Strategist Allocation Rule**
- Each Strategist supports 100 troops, with a minimum of 1 Strategist for armies smaller than 100 units.
- For full effect, 1 Strategist is needed per 100 troops in the army, even if not all troops have a damage bonus.

    **Example:**
  - If you have 100 Naginata, 100 Bushi, and 200 Ashigaru, you need 4 Strategists for full effect.
  - Strategists do not adjust per turn (e.g., 1 Strategist for Cavalry Charge or 2 for Infantry Combat is incorrect—you need enough for the entire army).

**Additional Damage Bonus Calculation**

- Each Strategist adds `0.7 + 0.05 × (level - 1)` bonus damage to units with special damage effects, such as: Bushi against Ashigaru, Lancers against Cavalry, Veterans, Masters against Special Units
Fanatics, Tengus, Cavalry types (Light, Heavy, Vanguard, Dragons, Kamis, and Onis) during their charge, Saboteurs and Assassins, etc.

**Exceptions:**
- Does not affect the damage bonus of Kamis and Warrior Monks against Dark Units.
- Does not affect ranged units.

**Example of Bonus Application**
- **Ashigaru + Ashigaru Leaders:** All Ashigaru receive +5 bonus due to their leaders.
- **Naginata + Strategists:** Strategists only grant the bonus when fighting Cavalry.
- **If Naginata + Strategists fight Bushi**, Strategists provide no benefit.

If an army contains Strategists, Leaders, or Generals of different levels, the game averages their levels.
**Example:**
10 Level 1 Strategists + 10 Level 3 Strategists → Treated as 20 Level 2 Strategists (always rounded down).
