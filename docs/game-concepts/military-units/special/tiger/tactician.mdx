<Admonition type="tip" title="Special Effect – Master of War">
  <ul>
    <li>Enhances all units that have a natural bonus against specific enemies, granting an additional damage boost.</li>
    <li>Functions similarly to Ashihei Captains or Warlords.</li>
    <li>Applies to units in allied or attached armies, as long as at least one Tactician is present among their ranks.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Tactician Allocation Rule</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each Tactician supports 100 troops, with a minimum of 1 Tactician for armies smaller than 100 units.</li>
    <li>For full effect, 1 Tactician is needed per 100 troops, even if not all troops have bonus effects.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> 100 Naginata, 100 Bushi, and 200 Ashihei → 4 Tacticians required for full effect.</li>
    <li>Tacticians do not adjust per turn (e.g., 1 Tactician for Cavalry Charge or 2 for Infantry Combat is incorrect—you need enough for the entire army).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Additional Damage Bonus Calculation</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each Tactician adds <code>0.7 + 0.05 × (level - 1)</code> bonus damage to units with special damage effects.</li>
    <li>Affects units such as: Bushi vs Ashihei, Lancers vs Cavalry, Masters vs Specials, Fanatics, Karasus, and Cavalry types during charges.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does not affect Kami or Warrior Monks’ bonus vs Dark Units.</li>
    <li>Does not affect ranged units.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Bonus Application Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ashihei + Ashihei Captains:</strong> All Ashihei get +5 damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Naginata + Tacticians:</strong> Bonus applies when fighting Cavalry only.</li>
    <li><strong>Naginata + Tacticians vs Bushi:</strong> No benefit given.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Level Averaging:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Different-level Tacticians average their levels (rounded down).</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> 10 Level 1 + 10 Level 3 = 20 Level 2 Tacticians.</li>
  </ul>
