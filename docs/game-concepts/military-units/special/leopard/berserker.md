# Berserker

## Overview

The Leopard Berserkers are ferocious warriors who unleash their full fury in a single battle. Once engaged in combat, they give in to their bloodlust, ignoring pain even when pierced by enemy arrows. As they near death, they raise their fist, letting out a fearsome war cry before making one final, devastating strike against their enemies.
