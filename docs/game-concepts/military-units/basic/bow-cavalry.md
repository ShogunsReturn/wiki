# Bow Cavalry

## Overview

### **Mounted Archer**  

Mounted Archers are highly trained warriors skilled in both **horseback riding** and **Kyūdō**, the art of archery. Their **versatility in battle** allows them to combine the effectiveness of **ranged combat** with the **mobility of their mounts**.  

They are **deadly projectile troops**, capable of **harassing enemy forces** from a distance while **avoiding direct melee combat** against infantry. Their agility on horseback allows them to **outmaneuver slower enemies** while striking with precision from afar.
