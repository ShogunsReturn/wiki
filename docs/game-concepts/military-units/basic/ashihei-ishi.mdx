# Ashihei With Ishi

## Overview

Ashihei with Ishi are trained in ranged combat. Their projectiles allow them to inflict casualties as the enemy approaches and during the early stages of battle. However, they are highly vulnerable if they lose infantry cover. Like basic Ashihei, they contribute to the province's workforce when stationed in their own province.
