# Light Cavalry

## Overview

Light cavalry units are trained in the art of horseback riding and the use of light weapons. Their speed and maneuverability make them highly effective against light infantry but vulnerable to heavy units and those with bonuses against cavalry, such as [Ashigaru with Yari](ashigaru-yari.md) and [Naginata](naginata.md).
