# Talent Tree

## How talent trees work
Each player has a number of **talent points** that must be distributed across the different talent trees. The total number of talent points is equal to the player's **level**.

### Talent Trees Overview

There are **three talent trees**, each affecting different aspects of the game:  
1. **Economic talents**: Focused on resource management and production.  
2. **Military talents**: Enhance army strength and strategy.  
3. **Political talents**: Improve political actions and influence.  

### Talent Selection Rules

- Some talents can be chosen **multiple times**, with their effects stacking.  
- Other talents can only be chosen **once**.  
- Certain talents have **dependencies**: You must allocate all points to a preceding talent before unlocking the next one.


### Tree Levels

- Each tree has **7 levels**.  
- To select a talent from level **X**, you must already have **(X-1) Ã— 5 talents** allocated in the lower levels of the same tree.
