# Houses

- Houses are a Quantity building, so we can build several at the same time and they have no limit.
- Houses are one of the most basic buildings in the game, they determine the maximum Population that can inhabit the province. Each house can accommodate up to 20 villagers.
- When starting a game, we already have some houses to provide shelter for the population we initially have.
- In addition, free houses encourage population growth. For each unoccupied house, population growth increases by 2 villagers/hour.

:::tip
Building many houses is the basis of a strong economy, since increasing the population means a greater income of gold and labor for carrying out resource gathering or construction tasks.
:::

The cost of each house is higher the more we have.
