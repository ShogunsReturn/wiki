# Houses

- Houses are a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Quantity building</Link>, so we can build several at the same time and they have no limit.
- Houses are one of the most basic buildings in the game. They determine the maximum **Population** that can inhabit the province. Each house can accommodate up to **20 villagers**.
- When starting a game, we already have some houses to provide shelter for the population we initially have.
- In addition, **free houses encourage population growth**. For each unoccupied house, population growth increases by **2 villagers/hour**.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Population Growth">
Building many houses is the basis of a strong economy, since increasing the population means a greater income of gold and labor for carrying out resource gathering or construction tasks.
</Admonition>

The cost of each house is higher the more we have.
