# Farms

- Farms are <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Quantity buildings</Link>, so you can build several at the same time and they don't have a limit.
- Farms determine the amount of people who can harvest meat. Up to **25 villagers** can work on each farm.
- Each villager on a farm produces **5 food/hour**. Meat, unlike rice, is a type of food that **can't be stored**, so it only serves to pay **maintenance**.
- When you start a game, you already have a few farms to harvest meat.

The cost of each farm is **higher the more you have**.
