# Gambling House *(in development)*

- The gambling house is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase it one level at a time and its construction has a maximum limit.
- The gambling house unlocks the **Betting Menu**, where you can train sumos and bet on their victories in championships.
- Each additional level of the gambling house increases the **amount of gold that can be bet**. For each level, you can bet an extra **5000 gold**.
- At **Level 2**, you can **view the fitness** of the sumos.
- From **Level 3** onwards, the amounts spent on training the sumos will yield an **additional 10% per level**.
