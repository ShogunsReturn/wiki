# Farms

- Farms are Quantity buildings, so you can build several at the same time and they don't have a limit.
- Farms determine the amount of people who can harvest meat. Up to 25 villagers can work on each farm.
- Each villager on a farm produces 5 food/hour. Meat, unlike rice, is a type of food that can't be stored, so it only serves to pay maintenance.
- When you start a game, you already have a few farms to harvest meat.

The cost of each farm is higher the more you have.
