# Mines

- Mines are a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Quantity building</Link>, so we can build several at the same time and they have no limit.
- Mines determine the amount of population that can harvest iron. Up to **15 villagers** can work in each mine.
- Each villager in a mine produces **1 iron/hour**.
- If you belong to the **Leopard** faction, up to **30 villagers** can work in the mines.

The cost of each mine is higher the more we have.
