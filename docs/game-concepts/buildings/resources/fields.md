# Fields

- Fields are Quantity buildings, so we can build several at the same time and they have no limit.
- Fields determine the amount of population that can harvest rice. Up to 20 villagers can work in each field.
- Each villager in a field produces 3 food/hour. Rice, unlike meat, is a type of food that we can store.
- When starting a game we already have some fields to harvest rice.

The cost of each field is higher the more we have.
