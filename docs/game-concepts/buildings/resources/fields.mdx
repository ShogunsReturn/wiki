# Fields

- Fields are <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Quantity buildings</Link>, so we can build several at the same time and they have no limit.
- Fields determine the amount of population that can harvest rice. Up to **20 villagers** can work in each field.
- Each villager in a field produces **3 food/hour**. Rice, unlike meat, is a type of food that **can be stored**.
- When starting a game we already have some fields to harvest rice.

The cost of each field is **higher the more you have**.
