# Mines

- Mines are Quantity buildings, so we can build several at the same time and they have no limit.
- Mines determine the amount of population that can harvest iron. Up to 15 villagers can work in each mine.
- Each villager in a mine produces 1 iron/hour.

The cost of each mine is higher the more we have.
