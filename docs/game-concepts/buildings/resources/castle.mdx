# Castle

- The castle is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase one level at a time and its construction has a maximum level.
- The castle is the base of the province's defense.
  - Each additional castle level adds **2000 resistance points** to the gate and **50 additional archers** to the defense.
  - These defenses will not act if a player is trying to break free without the help of other players.
  - The gate is immune to **projectile damage**.
  - The castle's archers, as well as the castle gate, are **replenished** in each battle.
  - The archers provided by the castle are **level 1** and **cannot be attacked** by any attacking troops.
  - Each turn that the castle's attackers try to break down the gate (starting from the combat turn following the elimination of the last defender), the castle's traps will cause **damage equal to 10%** of the attacking army's life, **only avoidable by armor**.
- The castle is the **only building** that cannot be destroyed or reversed by an expansion.
- Maintenance costs increase with each level and are calculated using the formula:
  `10 * (1 + (n - 2) * (n - 1) / 2)` (for levels 2 and above).
- The castle limits the number of **foreign armies** that can enter your city (**one per castle level**). Your armies do not count towards this limit.
- Each castle level allows you to **build on 100 new areas** available in your region. At **level one** you can build on **200**.
