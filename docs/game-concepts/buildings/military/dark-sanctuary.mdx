# Dark Sanctuary

- The Dark Sanctuary is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase one level at a time and its construction has a maximum limit.
- The Dark Sanctuary unlocks the creation of dark units.
- Each level of the Dark Sanctuary reduces Honor by 20 points.
- Each level of Dark Sanctuary brings dark units to your province for free to join your reserve.
- Each additional level of Dark Sanctuary increases the level of certain <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/military-units">Military Units</Link>.

### The dark sanctuary attracts units as follows

- Starting at level 2, it will begin to bring dark units of the maximum level that we have unlocked.
- The number of units will be determined as follows:
  - Summon Points: 20 * (Dark Sanctuary Level - 1)
  - To know how many units of each type arrive, it is divided by their cost in summon points:
    - Undead = 20
    - Gaki = 30
    - Dokumono = 45
    - Karasu = 90
    - Shugenja = 150
  - For each additional level unlocked, the cost will increase by 10%, so a level 2 Undead will cost 22 points.
