# Archery

- Archery is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase it by one level at a time and there is a maximum limit for its construction.
- Archery unlocks the creation of <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/military-units#ranged-units">ranged attack units</Link>.
- Each additional level of Archery increases the level of certain military units.

**Cost Table by Level:**
