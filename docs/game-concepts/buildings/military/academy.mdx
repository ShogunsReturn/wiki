# Academy

- The Academy is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase it one level at a time and its construction has a maximum limit.
- The Academy unlocks the creation of <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/military-units#special-units">special units</Link>: units unique to each <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/factions">Faction</Link>.
- Each additional Academy level increases the level of certain military Units.
