# Blacksmith

- The Blacksmith is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase one level at a time and its construction has a maximum limit.
- By building more levels of the Blacksmith you will be able to recruit certain military units that are also of a higher level, although some have another building as an additional requirement. These are: **Naginata**, **Nodachi**, **Heavy Rider**, **Karasu**, **Crane Kenshinzen**, **Tiger Master**, **Leopard Berserker**, and **Jigoku War Tower**.
- Similarly, the Blacksmith unlocks the <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/politics/army-policies#time-of-war">Time of War Policy</Link> and the samurai skills <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/samurais/picardy-skills#army-general">Great Endurance</Link> and <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/samurais/reasoning-skills#war-minister">Loyal Warriors</Link>.
