# Dojo

- The Dojo is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase one level at a time and its construction has a maximum limit.
- The Dojo unlocks the <Link to="/docs/game-menu/advanced-menu/armies">Army Menu</Link>, where you can activate recruiting units and creating armies.
- The Dojo unlocks the creation of <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/military-units#melee-infantry">infantry units</Link>.
- Each additional Dojo level increases the level of certain <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/military-units">military units</Link>.
- The Dojo will allow you to have more training stations. Every three levels will provide an additional station in addition to the initial one.
  - That is, with level 1 you will have one training station,
  - With level 3 you will have 2 training stations,
  - And from there on you will gain a training station every 3 levels (level 6, level 9, level 12...).
