# Stable

- The Stable is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase it one level at a time and its construction has a maximum limit.
- The Stable unlocks the creation of <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/military-units#melee-cavalry">cavalry units</Link>.
- Each additional level of the Stable increases the level of certain <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/military-units">military units</Link>.

**Cost Table by Level:**
