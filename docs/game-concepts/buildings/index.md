# Buildings

Building construction is a fundamental aspect of Shogun's Return. Buildings unlock various game menus and allow players to specialize in different playstyles. You can command building construction from the [Build Menu](../../game-menu/basic-menu/build.md).

## Types of buildings
Buildings are categorized into Quantity or Level types:

- **Quantity:** You can construct multiple buildings of this type simultaneously with no limit to their quantity.
  - Examples: Houses, Fields, Farms, Mines and Watchtowers.
- **Level:** You can only construct one at a time and level them up incrementally. 
  - Examples: Castle, Warehouse, Port, Market, Library, Council of Magistrates, Circle of Sages, Dojo, Blacksmith, Archery, Stable, Temple, Academy, Dark Sanctuary, Ninja Dojo, Thieves' Room and Assassins' Room.

:::note
To build each building or level it up we must be able to pay its cost and have buildable areas available.
