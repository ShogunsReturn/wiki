# Assassins Room *(in development)*

- The Assassin's Room is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase it by one level at a time, but in this case its construction has no maximum limit.

**Cost Table by Level:**

<CostByLevelTable building={playerBuildings["Assassins Room"]} />

### *In Development*

- The Assassin's Room unlocks the Assassinate Submenu and also the Poison Submenu, where Assassination and Poisoning missions can be ordered.
- Each additional Assassin's Room level increases the rank of the attributes for assassination and poisoning of the ninjas who are attracted to our <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings/ninjutsu/ninja-dojo">Ninja Dojo</Link> by 3 points. (The initial rank being 20â€“50)
