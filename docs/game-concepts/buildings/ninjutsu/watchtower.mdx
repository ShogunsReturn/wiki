# Watchtower

- Watchtowers are a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Quantity building</Link>, so we can build several at the same time and they have no limit.
- Each additional watchtower allows you to see an enemy attack or movement 4 minutes beforehand.
- Each watchtower costs 10 gold/hour.

The cost of each watchtower is higher the more we have.

### *In Development*

- Watchtowers make it difficult for enemy ninjas to carry out Ninja Missions in our province. The more Watchtowers there are, the more difficult it will be.
- Each watchtower adds +1 to the difficulty of ninja actions in your province (this added difficulty can be reduced by the ninja minister of subterfuge's skill Misdirection Techniques).
