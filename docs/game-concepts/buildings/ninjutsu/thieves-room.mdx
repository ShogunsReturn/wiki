# Thieves Room *(in development)*

- The Thief Room is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase it one level at a time, but in this case its construction has no maximum limit.

**Cost Table by Level:**

<CostByLevelTable building={playerBuildings["Thieves Room"]} />

### *In Development*

- The Thief Room unlocks the Steal Submenu, where you can order Steal missions.
- Each additional Thief Room level increases the stealing attribute range of the ninjas attracted to your Ninja Dojo by 3 points. (The initial range is 20â€“50)
