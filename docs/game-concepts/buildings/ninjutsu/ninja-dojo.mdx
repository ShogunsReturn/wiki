# Ninja Dojo *(in development)*

- The Ninja Dojo is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase it one level at a time, but in this case its construction has no maximum limit.

**Cost Table by Level:**

<CostByLevelTable building={playerBuildings["Ninja Dojo"]} />

### *In Development*

- The Ninja Dojo unlocks the Ninjutsu Menu, where Ninja Missions can be ordered.
- Each additional Ninja Dojo level allows you to attract a greater number of ninjas to your province.
- Each additional Ninja Dojo level increases the range of the spy attributes of the ninjas who are attracted to your ninja dojo by 2 points. (The initial range being 30â€“60)
