# Library

- The Library is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase it one level at a time and its construction has a maximum limit.
- The Library unlocks the Politics Menu, where Political Actions can be activated.
- Each Library level unlocks different Political Actions and skills for Samurai.
- Each additional Library level increases the limit at which Samurai attributes can be created and trained by 2.5 points.

**Cost Table by Level:**

<CostByLevelTable building={playerBuildings["Library"]} />

---

### *In Development*

- Each additional Market level increases the level of the following Crafting Items: Logging Saws, Mining Tools, Ikebana Ornaments, and Fireworks.
