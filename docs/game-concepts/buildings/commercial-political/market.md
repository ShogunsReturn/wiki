### *In Development*

- The market unlocks the Trade Menu, where you can buy, sell, and ship resources, as well as craft items.
- At market level 2, the resource shipping submenu is unlocked.
- At market level 3, the crafting submenu is unlocked.
- Each additional market level reduces the taxes you pay when making offers. Level 1: 150 gold, Level 2: 100 gold, Level 3: 50 gold, Level 4: 25 gold, Level 5 or higher: 10 gold
- Each additional market level increases the amount of resources you can ship. The maximum amount of resources you can ship is 2000*(level-1), except at level 1, which is 1000.
- The market level limits how much you can get in a day. The base manageable resources are double what you can send, and can be increased up to a maximum of three times as much by your trading activity.
- A unit of food takes up 1 sack, a unit of gold takes up 2 sacks, a unit of wood takes up 3 sacks, and finally, a unit of iron takes up 4 sacks. Thus, 600 units of food take up the same sacks as 300 units of gold, 200 units of wood, or 150 units of iron.
- Each time you receive resources, the corresponding sacks will be subtracted from the number of manageable sacks, while making shipments will increase the number of manageable sacks available by 75% of the corresponding sacks according to the resource sent.
- Each additional market level increases the number of merchants. The number of merchants is 1 + market level /2.
- Each additional market level increases the level of the following Crafted Items: Geisha Parasols, Stone Lamps, Fans, and Warrior Statues.
