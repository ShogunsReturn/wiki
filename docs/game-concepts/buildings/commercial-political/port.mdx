# Port

- The port is a <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/buildings#types-of-buildings">Level building</Link>, so we can only increase one level at a time.
- The port is a building that provides a fixed income of Resources.
- In the first levels it only provides meat, but later we will get gold, wood, iron and even population.
- There is no limit on the levels of this building.
- Additionally, the first level allows you to move armies from one island to another.

### Resources provided by the port

- <code>200 × level</code> in <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/resources#meat">meat</Link>.
- From level 5: <code>100 × (level-4)</code> in <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/resources#gold">gold</Link>.
- From level 10: <code>50 × (level-9)</code> in <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/resources#wood">wood</Link>.
- From level 15: <code>25 × (level-14)</code> in <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/resources#iron">iron</Link>.
- From level 20: <code>5 × (level-19)</code> in <Link to="/docs/game-concepts/population">population</Link>.
