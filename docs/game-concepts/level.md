# Level

The level indicates the player's experience. To level up, the player must reach certain thresholds of accumulated Glory, meaning the total Glory earned across all completed games. There are a total of 40 levels. Players can view their level and the amount of Glory needed to reach the next level on the main page of the Account Manager.

Each level grants the player one talent point, which can be allocated in their talent tree before starting a game.
