# Shogun

The **Shogun** is the player ranked #1 on the general player leaderboard.

---

### How Do I Become the Number One?

The ranking system depends on the [type of game](./games.md) being played, but generally, it is based on the amount of **glory** players have accumulated. To reach the top, you must:  
1. Achieve more **glory** than any other player.  
2. Organize an **assembly** (a political action) to update the rankings.

### How to Organize an Assembly?

- Unlock the [politics menu](../game-menu/advanced-menu/politics.md) and navigate to the **Specials** subcategory.  
- The player who organizes any assembly will be recognized by the Emperor and awarded [Imperial Favors](./imperial-favors.md). However, the earlier an assembly is organized, the more expensive it will be.  
- Only one player can activate this action at a time, so be the first to claim the **Imperial reward**.

### Benefits of Being Shogun

Upon achieving the Shogunate, you gain:  
- **30 Imperial Favors**.  
- **Extra gold production**: +500 gold/hour.  
- **Extra population growth**: +50 villagers/hour.  

You can see who holds the Shogun title in the **Dynasty panel** and view the Shogun history for the game in the **Shoguns** submenu within the [Rankings Menu](../game-menu/general-menu/rankings.md).

### Imperial Respect

Earning **Imperial Respect points** is a common goal in various game types.  

#### How to Earn Imperial Respect Points?
- Players earn these points by becoming Shogun and maintaining their leadership for a certain number of days.  
- The required number of days varies between games, typically ranging from **2 to 5 days**.  
- Even within the same game, the required days can change. Early in the game, more days are needed, while later in the game, fewer days are required to speed up its conclusion.  

#### Respect Point Penalty
- For each Imperial Respect point earned, the current Shogun gains **10% less glory**, making it harder to maintain the Shogunate as they approach victory.
