# Durations

Shogun’s Return is a real-time game. This means that the game continues to evolve even when players are offline. Therefore, the way to play Shogun’s Return is to log in and order a series of events. By calculating when these events will end, we can know when it is necessary to log back in and continue issuing new orders.

Almost all orders in Shogun’s Return take a certain amount of time to execute. Some of these times are fixed, variable and adjustable.

- **Fixed times:** These are times that never vary. 
:::note Example
The time to create units, the time to activate and recharge a political action or the time to create a samurai. These times are only reduced by the effects of magistrates.
:::

- **Variable times:** These are times that vary depending on the distances between players.
:::note Example
The time to carry out an attack, an army movement, a ninja mission or a resource shipment. These times vary depending on the distance between players.
:::

- **Adjustable times:** These are those that we can adjust depending on our preferences. 
:::note Example
Construction times can be longer or shorter depending on the number of workers we assign to the construction task.
