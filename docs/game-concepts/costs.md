# Costs

Costs are the resources (population, buildable area, etc.) that must be paid when requesting a policy, building certain buildings, forming units, forming samurai, creating armies, etc.

In order to pay a cost, we must have the required amount available (we can see this quickly by looking at the resource table). 

If you do not have the necessary amount of a resource to cover the cost, the required amount will be shown in red.

:::note
Half of the cost is recovered when cancelling the required action (or in the case of ninja missions, if it fails).
