# Resources

Resources are the raw materials that we must obtain in order to pay the costs and maintenance of buildings, armies, political actions, etc. We can see the actions and events that affect the increase or decrease of our resources from the [Resources Menu](../game-menu/basic-menu/resources.md).

The Basic resources are: **Food**, **Wood**, **Iron** and **Gold**. In addition to the basic resources, there is a special resource known as **Imperial Favor**. This resource is more challenging to obtain and is used to pay for the best units and political actions in the game.

## Food

Food is a resource used to cover the maintenance costs of villagers and troops, as well as to pay for the construction of certain [buildings](../game-concepts/buildings/index.md) and [military units](./military-units/index.md). There are two ways to produce food: **rice harvesting** and **meat gathering**.

1. ### Rice

- The number of effective workers in rice harvesting is limited by the number of **fields**.  
- Rice production is lower than meat production but has the advantage of being storable in the **warehouse**.  
- Since rice production is lower, it is better to build **farms** to feed your population and **fields** to store food and cover building and unit costs.  

However, if there are not enough farms, the harvested rice will be used to cover maintenance expenses.

1. ### Meat

- The number of effective workers in meat gathering is limited by the number of **farms**.  
- Unlike rice, **meat cannot be stored**, so its production only serves to cover maintenance costs.  
- Meat production is higher than rice production, making it an efficient way to meet immediate food requirements.  

To properly balance meat production:  
- Aim to use meat to fully cover all maintenance costs, so that harvested rice can be stored.  
- Avoid assigning more workers than necessary to meat gathering, as excess meat cannot be saved.

## Wood

**Wood** is produced in the forest and is an essential resource for constructing buildings and creating units.

### Forest Dynamics

- The size of the forest in your province is determined by the difference between the **total area** of the province and the **built area**.  
- The more buildings you construct, the smaller the forest becomes, and consequently, the less wood you can gather.
- The forest regenerates gradually over time. However, if you assign too many workers to wood gathering and exceed the natural regeneration rate, the forest will gradually shrink.  

---

### Forest Regeneration

- If the **regeneration rate** is higher than the amount of wood harvested, the forest will grow back to its maximum size.  
- Conversely, if you harvest more wood than the forest can regenerate, the forest area will shrink.  
- The regeneration rate of a forest depends on its size: **the larger the forest, the higher the regeneration rate.**  

### Worker Capacity

The total number of workers that can gather wood depends on the forest's size. A larger forest allows more workers to gather wood simultaneously.  

<!-- ### Boosting Forest Regeneration

- Certain **political actions** and **Economy Minister abilities** can increase the forest's regeneration rate. -->

- Another way to obtain **Wood** is by upgrading the **[Port](./buildings/commercial-political/port.md) levels**.

## Iron
To gather iron, you must construct mines. Iron is a vital resource required to cover the costs of certain buildings and units.
- Each mine allows a specific number of villagers to work and extract iron.
- The more mines you build, the greater your iron production capacity.

## Gold

**Gold** is a critical resource used to cover various maintenance costs and expenses. It is primarily produced through **taxes on the population**, with each unit of population generating **1 gold/hour**. Additional sources of gold include upgrading the [**market**](./buildings/commercial-political/market.md) and [**port levels**](./buildings/commercial-political/port.md).

### Usage

- All [military units](./military-units/index.md), <!-- samurai, ninjas on espionage missions,  -->[watchtower guards](./buildings/ninjutsu/watchtower.md), [armies](./armies.md), and other elements require hourly gold maintenance.  
- Recruiting units will convert tax-paying villagers into soldiers who draw salaries, so managing the gold balance carefully is crucial.

<!-- ### Corruption

Storing large amounts of gold leads to losses due to corruption.  
- **Honor** directly impacts corruption:  
  - Higher honor reduces corruption.  
  - Negative honor increases corruption.  

With neutral honor, every **200 gold coins above 7,500** results in a **5 gold/hour penalty**.

The **Imperial State** political action reduces corruption by **50%**.

### Popular Revolts

Revolts occur when your peasants demand an appropriate use of gold.  
- The likelihood of revolts increases as your net gold income (**income - expenses**) grows, especially if there is no significant military or ninja spending to balance it.  
- Your armies or relations with the ninja guild can help calm the population.

---

#### **Revolt Cost Formula**  
1. **Revolt Threshold**:  
   Threshold = 4000 + (50 * each Ninja Dojo or Room level) + (25 * each military building level) + salaries of units

2. **Revolt Cost**:  
   If net gold exceeds the threshold, the cost of the revolt is calculated as:  
   (Net Gold - Threshold) *  (Net Gold / (Net Gold + Threshold))

## Imperial Favors *(in development)*

**Imperial Favors** are the most coveted resource in the game.  

- They are exclusively required for the **most powerful political actions** and **military units**.  
- These actions and units can significantly influence the outcome of a game, making Imperial Favors a crucial strategic asset.
