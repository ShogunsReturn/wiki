# Games

In Shogunâ€™s Return, games are played as if it were a board game. The duration of each game can vary depending on the players' progress and the type of game, but it typically lasts no less than 3 weeks and no more than 2 months.

Whenever a game starts, it is announced in the discord server, official social media, and a countdown begins in the "Join" tab of the account manager. <!-- Additionally, there is an option to receive notifications via email. -->

Each game has a title, a start date, and a game type that determines the victory conditions.

Every game offers a unique and different experience from the previous ones.

- Monday. -- The game starts at 12:00.
- Tuesday. -- At 24:00 --> Closing of new players in the game.
- Wednesday: -- At 24:00 --> If there are more than 1000 players, they will be eliminated from the 1001st (included) according to ranking.

#### Game:

- Random positions in each province; players cannot choose to start next to another specific player.
- There will always be an additional assembly at 24:00 before eliminating players (and another one immediately after so that eliminated players appear in the rankings).
- Certain menus will be blocked:
    - No allies will be allowed, but players can mark others as enemies.
    - Clans will be disabled.
    - Trading, shipments, and crafting will not be available.
- Construction speed will be doubled to accelerate the game.
- Initial Glory:
    - Takeshi_Jr: 75
    - Takeshi: 125
        > *These values will remain fixed throughout the game and will not increase.*
- The number of troops in Takeshi's army will be doubled. Players will start as vassals of Takeshi, but this will not result in any player being eliminated.
- Takeshi characters cannot be eliminated for failing to meet the cut-off nor can they be attacked.

#### Interface:

<!-- - A special plugin has been added for this type of game to inform us (ranking position, next cutoff date, link to already eliminated, etc,...).
- You will be able to see a list of eliminated players: Date + Player + Player who conquered him. -->
- All eliminated players will be able to see their account, messages, although this will be frozen, it will appear on the map, but you will not be able to do anything with it or interact. This will allow you to see the rankings until the game ends and also the messages before they eliminated us (if they do).

<!-- ## Winter

Games, regardless of their type, can have the winter feature. In these games, a plugin appears that indicates the season in which the empire is located. Every 6 hours the season changes:

- From 7am to 1pm it is spring
- From 1pm to 7pm it is summer
- From 7pm to 1am it is autumn
- From 1am to 7am it is winter

During winter, no type of army movement (including attacks or liberations), ninja missions or trade pacts can be carried out. Neither can these types of actions be started if they are going to end in winter.

Winter is a feature that makes games more relaxed, since it means that during the night hours there is no possibility of receiving attacks. -->
