# Requirements

Requirements are conditions that must be met in order to perform certain political actions, recruit certain units, or build certain buildings.

Requirements are usually having a certain amount of honor or having built certain buildings, although you will find cases where they are having a previously active policy, or even having unlocked some advantage from the talent tree.

The requirements for building buildings are summarized in the Technology Tree image (Build Menu).

Those policies in which the requirements are not met will be aligned at the bottom of the screen and with a lower contrast.
