# Population

The population represents the number of men and women in your province. In the resources panel, you can always see your current population. You can review all factors that influence population growth or decline in the [Management submenu](../game-menu/basic-menu/resources.md#management-submenu) within the [Resources Menu](../game-menu/basic-menu/resources.md).

### Why is the Population Important?

Population is the foundation of your province’s economy for two main reasons:  
1. It provides a significant gold income (**1 gold/hour per unit of population**).  
2. It serves as the workforce for resource gathering and construction tasks. The larger your population, the more workers you can assign to these tasks, enabling faster growth.  

Additionally:  
- A larger population allows you to recruit more military units (as male villagers are required to form warriors).  
- Some political actions ([Good Relations](/docs/game-concepts/politics/army-politics#good-relations), [People's Rebellion](/docs/game-concepts/politics/army-politics#rebellion-of-the-people)) become stronger with a larger population.  
- A larger population helps protect your resources from potential theft.

### Differences Between Men and Women

- **Men and women** are equally effective in resource gathering and construction tasks.  
- However, **recruiting military units** reduces only the male population.  
- Over time, the population tends to balance itself between men and women.

### How to Grow the Population

The demographic flow is automatic, meaning you don't need to take direct action. However, if your housing capacity is maxed out, you must focus on making your province attractive enough to compensate for reasons that might cause inhabitants to leave.

:::tip Tip for Rapid Population Growth
**Build many houses**: The more unoccupied houses you have, the faster your population will grow. As houses fill up, the growth rate will slow.
:::

:::info Example
If you have a current population of **100 villagers and 10 houses**:  
- Population limit = `10 houses x 20 villagers per house = 200 villagers max.`  
- Free slots = `200 max - 100 current = 100 free slots.`  
- Free houses = `100 free slots ÷ 20 capacity per house = 5 free houses.`  
- Population growth = `2 villagers per free house = 10 villagers per hour.`

### Factors That Increase Population
- **Positive honor**: Every 2 honor points above 0 attract 1 villager/hour.  
- **Abilities and attributes of magistrates** (e.g., [Popular Leader](./samurais/charisma-skills#politics-minister), [Civil Leader](./samurais/charisma-skills#economy-minister)).  
- **Political actions** (e.g., **Lotus Festival**, [Power of the People](./politics/resources-politics#power-of-the-people)) and having a [port](./buildings/commercial-political/port) at level 20 or higher.  
- **Disbanding units** from your armies.  
- Being a member of the **leading clan** in the game (+20 villagers/hour). *(in development)*
- **Personal titles**:  
   - Shogun (+50 villagers/hour)  
   - Shogun or Regional Leader (+25 villagers/hour) *(in development)* 
   - Faction Leader (+25 villagers/hour) *(in development)*

### Factors That Decrease Population
- **Overpopulation**:  
   - When you exceed 1,000 villagers, some will leave due to a preference for quieter provinces.  
   - For every 20 villagers above 1,000, you lose 1 villager/hour.  
   - Additional losses occur for every 20 villagers above 2,000, 3,000, and so on.  
- **Losing honor** through:  
   - Dishonorable political actions ([Exemplary Punishment](./politics/resources-politics#exemplary-punishment), **Promise of Power**, etc.).  
   - Applying excessive taxes (above 15%).  
   - Betrayals by your ninjas.  
   - Using dark units in your armies.
- Having **Onis**.
- Recruiting male villagers into armies.  
- Being part of the **Jigoku faction**, which converts villagers into undead. *(in development)*

### Population Maintenance Cost

Each unit of population incurs a maintenance cost of **1 food/hour** and requires housing.

---

### Workers

Workers are units you can assign to resource gathering and construction tasks.  
- Workers consist of:  
  - Your population (both men and women).  
  - [Ashihei](/docs/game-concepts/military-units#traits-and-abilities) stationed in your province.  
  - [Temporary workers](./politics/resources-politics#temporal-villagers) from political actions.
