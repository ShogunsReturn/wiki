<p>Shogun’s Return is a strategy game inspired by the mythology of feudal Japan. In each game, thousands of players compete simultaneously in real time to become Shogun.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-technical-requirements-do-i-need-to-have-in-order-to-play-shoguns-return">What technical requirements do I need to have in order to play Shogun’s Return?<a href="#what-technical-requirements-do-i-need-to-have-in-order-to-play-shoguns-return" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What technical requirements do I need to have in order to play Shogun’s Return?" title="Direct link to What technical requirements do I need to have in order to play Shogun’s Return?">​</a></h3>
<p>Shogun’s Return works through a website and does not require any download. All you need to play is a computer with an Internet connection and a web browser. Due to the high load of Javascript, the use of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome browsers is recommended.</p>

<p>From the start of each Shogun’s Return game, the world continues to evolve even when we are not playing. Therefore, the way to play Shogun’s Return is to enter the game, order a series of events and exit. Knowing the time in which these events will end, we can know when it is necessary to reconnect and continue issuing new orders. Generally, to play Shogun’s Return you only need to connect two or three sessions of 5 minutes throughout the day to properly manage your game.</p>

<p>The duration of each game varies depending on the victory conditions, determined by the type of game. It also depends on the development of each game. As a general rule, each game lasts between 4 and 8 weeks.</p>

<p>You must create a game account from the main page. Once created, you will enter the account manager, from where you can select from the available games to join.</p>

<p>A user can only create and manage one account. Multiple accounts are not allowed in Shogun’s Return and are penalized by the Phoenix system.</p>

<p>On the main page, next to the login, you will find a link called “Forgot your password?” Click on it and we will ask for your account email, where we will send a message with your username and password.</p>

<p>You can play without problems at the same time, even belonging to the same clan. However, the Phoenix system will limit your interaction with the players with whom you share an IP.</p>

<p>During the first 24 hours you can leave the game by clicking on the &quot;Start over&quot; plugin or from the Edit submenu, options tab, within the Profile Menu. You will disappear from the game and can log in again by choosing your initial nickname, faction and region again.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-want-to-leave-a-game-what-should-i-do">I want to leave a game, what should I do?<a href="#i-want-to-leave-a-game-what-should-i-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I want to leave a game, what should I do?" title="Direct link to I want to leave a game, what should I do?">​</a></h3>
<p>Accounts can only be deleted during the 24 hours of gameplay, otherwise they cannot be deleted manually. The game automatically deletes all accounts that have not built a castle level and have been inactive in a game for 5 days.</p>

<p>There are total areas or hectares of forest (500 at the start) that will decrease as you build new buildings down to a minimum of 100. Of those hectares, there will be a few with forest and others that you have already cut down. Example: 150/320 means that you have 150 hectares of forest (that you can cut down) out of a total of 320. If you were to build 20 houses now (20 hectares) you would have 150/300. The forest regenerates at a rate that increases the more hectares of forest you have. Also, the more hectares of forest you have, the more villagers can work on them. There are also several ways to increase the amount of forest areas as the game progresses.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-many-units-of-wood-can-i-get-from-one-hectare">How many units of wood can I get from one hectare?<a href="#how-many-units-of-wood-can-i-get-from-one-hectare" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How many units of wood can I get from one hectare?" title="Direct link to How many units of wood can I get from one hectare?">​</a></h3>
<p>100 units per hectare cut down.</p>

<p>Yes. So they make the forest degrade faster (although you also get the wood faster).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-i-increase-my-maximum-forest-hectares">How do I increase my maximum forest hectares?<a href="#how-do-i-increase-my-maximum-forest-hectares" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do I increase my maximum forest hectares?" title="Direct link to How do I increase my maximum forest hectares?">​</a></h3>
<p>By destroying things you have built, buying land from the emperor, with the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Lands&quot; policy, or with landmarks, earned by accumulating glory during the game. But you still have to regenerate these new hectares in order to cut them down.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-do-you-receive-resources-from-crafting">When do you receive resources from crafting?<a href="#when-do-you-receive-resources-from-crafting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When do you receive resources from crafting?" title="Direct link to When do you receive resources from crafting?">​</a></h3>
<p>As you make items you receive the resources. You don&#x27;t receive them all at once at the end or at the beginning.</p>

<p>Policies that consume food are cancelled and units are removed until the situation is corrected. If you have no troops, villagers die. The same happens if you run out of gold (in this case, villagers don&#x27;t die, as they don&#x27;t consume gold).</p>

<p>Evenly among all the buildings. If you pause one of them it would be as if it didn&#x27;t exist and the villagers would be evenly distributed among the remaining ones.</p>

<p>No. Houses are only for villagers. Soldiers don&#x27;t count towards that limit.</p>

<p>Nothing. The buildings are kept but you will have to pay rent for the built lands that exceed the maximum you have.</p>

<p>Yes. Armies have to prepare for the attack for 2 hours. This preparation is carried out in the province they are going to invade and therefore the lord of that province is informed that there is an army that wants to invade it. If you have watchtowers, this warning will arrive before the army starts to prepare and the more watchtowers you have, the sooner you will be informed of the attack. Therefore, at least 2 hours before the attack you will always be warned, whether you have watchtowers or not. Example: if you have 15 watchtowers, you will be warned 2:30 hours before. If you don&#x27;t have any, 2 hours.</p>

<p>Leading an attack or a defense is necessary for some policies. Example: Studying the terrain The next battle you lead as an attacker, the traps will not have an effect on your troops. Remember that traps do not activate when you free yourself.</p>
<p>The leader of an attack or defense is determined by the following rules:</p>
<p>Leader in attack: The owner of the attacking army that has (if any) the other attacking armies associated with it.</p>
<p>Leader in defense: Each of the owners of the NON-associated armies defending the province plus the owner of the province. If A is associated with B, and C and D are associated with E, the defense is led by B, E, plus the owner of the province if different, since they are not associated with anyone.</p>

<p>By building new levels of ninjutsu buildings, you will make new ninjas who come more powerful, but this will not affect the ninjas already in your ninja dojo.

<p>No. Only the specific mission attribute affects it. Example: if we send a ninja to spy, only the spy attribute influences it. If we send him to steal, only the steal attribute influences it.

If you put a samurai to train a skill, he will take the time required by that skill to learn it. Once he has finished, he will continue training the characteristic associated with that skill until he is told otherwise or reaches the maximum score allowed. Training the skill has an associated cost, but the subsequent improvement of the corresponding attribute does not.</p>

<p>Yes and yes, but the skills will only be activated when the samurai is in the corresponding ministry. Example: A samurai has both war and economic skills. If you put him as minister of war, only war skills will work, and if you put him in the minister of economy, only economic skills will work. If you put him in another position, none of them will work.</p>

<p>No. If you cancel, he loses the training he had at that point and would have to start over. Example: You put a samurai in training and it takes 45 minutes for him to gain a point. If you cancel when 13 minutes are left and then put him in training again, it will take 45 minutes for him to gain a point.</p>

<p>There are two policies that allow you to do this: &quot;Oath&quot; and &quot;Impersonate.&quot; The first is permanent and the second is temporary.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-i-change-factions-between-games">Can I change factions between games?<a href="#can-i-change-factions-between-games" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Can I change factions between games?" title="Direct link to Can I change factions between games?">​</a></h3>
<p>Yes. When you join a game you always have the option to choose which faction you want to play as. The next game will be the same, so you can change if you want.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="which-faction-is-better">Which faction is better?<a href="#which-faction-is-better" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Which faction is better?" title="Direct link to Which faction is better?">​</a></h3>
<p>There is no faction that is better than the others at everything. Snakes are very good at ninjutsu and dark. Dragons gather resources much better than the rest and their magic units are more durable. If you are looking for defense, Tigers are your choice and if you are looking for attack, Leopards will do a good job. Cranes collect much more gold from their villagers. And Ronin have the cheapest buildings of all and better ashigarus. As you can see, each faction is good at something and you can achieve great things with all of them.</p>

<p>No, but it is advisable to take advantage of the faction bonuses they have. You could go for ninjutsu as a dragon even if it is not as efficient. There is nothing stopping you.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s not necessary. When you start a new game, you&#x27;re asked if you want to use the account name or not. You can enter another name there so that during that game you&#x27;ll have another name.</p>

<p>It basically boils down to &quot;accounts that share an IP cannot interact in any way.&quot; Depending on the degree of interaction, the sanctions will be greater or lesser.</p>
<p>Phoenix is ​​automatic. I don&#x27;t think that leaving ban decisions to an automatic system is a good thing.</p>
<p>Phoenix is ​​automatic and is a tool that serves as an aid to the person in charge of controlling multiple accounts. Behind the ban decisions there is always a person who looks at the cases that occur one by one. Decisions are not left to the system.</p>

<p>It is an indicator of a player&#x27;s worth in the different aspects of the game. It is earned by fighting battles, building buildings, spending resources, ninja missions, etc. and only decreases when you are conquered by another player (actually, being free gives you a 10% bonus to glory, so technically, glory never decreases, it just goes back to normal with no bonus when conquered). Your score can range from 0 to infinity. You start each game at 0, and the glory you earn in each game is accumulated to calculate your overall ranking and talent points. The more glory you have, the more talents you have to use when starting new games.</p>

<p>It is an indicator of how honorable you are as a leader of your city. It is gained in various ways, and can also be lost.
