### I want to leave a game, what should I do?
Accounts can only be deleted during the 24 hours of gameplay, otherwise they cannot be deleted manually. The game automatically deletes all accounts that have not built a castle level and have been inactive in a game for 5 days.

## RESOURCES, TRADE AND CRAFTS

### How does the forest work?
There are total areas or hectares of forest (500 at the start) that will decrease as you build new buildings down to a minimum of 100. Of those hectares, there will be a few with forest and others that you have already cut down. Example: 150/320 means that you have 150 hectares of forest (that you can cut down) out of a total of 320. If you were to build 20 houses now (20 hectares) you would have 150/300. The forest regenerates at a rate that increases the more hectares of forest you have. Also, the more hectares of forest you have, the more villagers can work on them. There are also several ways to increase the amount of forest areas as the game progresses.

### How many units of wood can I get from one hectare?
100 units per hectare cut down.

### Do faction and minister bonuses make you cut down the forest more?
Yes. So they make the forest degrade faster (although you also get the wood faster).

### How do I increase my maximum forest hectares?
By destroying things you have built, buying land from the emperor, with the "Emperor's Lands" policy, or with landmarks, earned by accumulating glory during the game. But you still have to regenerate these new hectares in order to cut them down.

### When do you receive resources from crafting?
As you make items you receive the resources. You don't receive them all at once at the end or at the beginning.

### What happens if you run out of food?
Policies that consume food are cancelled and units are removed until the situation is corrected. If you have no troops, villagers die. The same happens if you run out of gold (in this case, villagers don't die, as they don't consume gold).

### Can a market transaction be cancelled?
No.

### Can 'Takeshis' buy things?
No. They can only sell.

## BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCTIONS

### If I place several buildings at once, how are the villagers that are building distributed?
Evenly among all the buildings. If you pause one of them it would be as if it didn't exist and the villagers would be evenly distributed among the remaining ones.

### How much resources do I get back if I cancel a construction?
Half of what it costs.

### Do soldiers occupy the houses you build?
No. Houses are only for villagers. Soldiers don't count towards that limit.

### If the effect of the "Emperor's Lands" runs out, what happens to the buildings built in those areas?
Nothing. The buildings are kept but you will have to pay rent for the built lands that exceed the maximum you have.

### I don't have watchtowers, but they warn me of an attack on my province. Is this correct?
Yes. Armies have to prepare for the attack for 2 hours. This preparation is carried out in the province they are going to invade and therefore the lord of that province is informed that there is an army that wants to invade it. If you have watchtowers, this warning will arrive before the army starts to prepare and the more watchtowers you have, the sooner you will be informed of the attack. Therefore, at least 2 hours before the attack you will always be warned, whether you have watchtowers or not. Example: if you have 15 watchtowers, you will be warned 2:30 hours before. If you don't have any, 2 hours.

## UNITS AND ARMIES

### What is the point of attacking other players?
If you conquer another player, you will become his lord and he will become your subject. You will be able to collect taxes from him which will increase your resource income and you will be able to see some of his private information (armies and approximate number of his troops, resources, buildings, etc. except the part related to ninjitsu).

### Can I attack my lord?
Yes and no. If you lead the attack, you cannot attack him, his lord, or anyone else in that chain of subjects. You must first free yourself. However, if you are an associate of another player's army (i.e. you are not leading the attack) you can. Obviously, that other player must also follow this rule.

### I have a lord that I like and I am told that another one is coming to conquer me. Can I ally with my lord to repel the attack?
Yes. You just have to give your armies the order to defend. Please note that your reserve units will never defend. To be used you have to put them in an army.

### Can I ally with a player to free me?
Yes. You will have to associate your armies with theirs (outside your province) and then you will have to attack your province (if you are the main army you will have to free them and if not you will have to attack).

### Does the castle affect my liberations?
No, as long as you are only going to free yourself. If an ally's army helps you, the castle will act as if they were attacking you.

### If I have an army in a subject and it is levying can I give it the order not to defend?
No. A levying army will always defend itself from attacks.

### If my army dies completely when trying to invade a province, do I get the full battle report or does it just tell me that I havebeen wiped out?

Does the full battle report always come.

### Can I conquer a member of my clan?
No. If they were someone's subject, attacking them and defeating them will free them and your army will stay in your companion's province.

### Do all armies move at the same speed?
No. An army composed only of cavalry will move at twice the normal speed and the minister of war can give you a speed bonus.

### Is there any advantage to having the units split up? That is, if I have 200 ashis, is it better to put them in 50, 50, 50 and 50than all 200 in one slot?

There is no advantage.

### To keep a subject, is it necessary to leave an army on top of it?
Yes. Once you conquer it you have to leave an army or else it will automatically be freed.

### How can I transfer troops to an ally to include them in their army?
You cannot do it directly. What you can do is associate your army with theirs. To do this, both armies must be in the same province.

### How do I know which bonuses affect a unit?
In the recruit units tab, the description of the units and the type of unit they are appears. Example: Vanguard. It is a special unit but it also says that it is cavalry. Therefore, it receives the bonuses that affect cavalry or special units.

### If I make archers, for example, and then I improve archery, does this bonus improvement apply to the units already made?
No. You will have to re-train the units again to level them up.

### Can I associate armies that are already associated?
No. Example: You have 3 armies A, B and C. C is associated with B (main B). If you now want to associate B with A (main A) you will not be able to because B has associates. Yes, you can do the opposite, that is, A can associate with B since B would still be the main one. In this case B would have 2 associates. A and C.

It is only possible to associate with an army that leads a previous association or that is alone.

### I have seen that the ashigarus of a province work as if they were villagers. However, my lord has ashigarus in my province andthey do not work. Why?

The lord can decide if he wants his ashigarus to work or not in the provinces of his subjects. You can still negotiate with him to do so 😉

### What does it mean to lead an attack? And a defense? Who is the leader in each case?
Leading an attack or a defense is necessary for some policies. Example: Studying the terrain The next battle you lead as an attacker, the traps will not have an effect on your troops. Remember that traps do not activate when you free yourself.

The leader of an attack or defense is determined by the following rules:

Leader in attack: The owner of the attacking army that has (if any) the other attacking armies associated with it.

Leader in defense: Each of the owners of the NON-associated armies defending the province plus the owner of the province. If A is associated with B, and C and D are associated with E, the defense is led by B, E, plus the owner of the province if different, since they are not associated with anyone.

## NINJUTSU

### How can I improve a ninja's attributes?
By building new levels of ninjutsu buildings, you will make new ninjas who come more powerful, but this will not affect the ninjas already in your ninja dojo. To improve the latter, all you can do is send them on missions and hope they succeed. For each success, the ninja will gain a few points in the attribute he used in that mission.

### What is the maximum level a ninja can have?
A ninja does not have a maximum level. The larger the ninja dojo (or thief/assassin room), the higher his level will be, and it can be increased by successfully completing ninja missions.

### Do all of the ninja's attributes influence the completion of a mission?
No. Only the specific mission attribute affects it. Example: if we send a ninja to spy, only the spy attribute influences it. If we send him to steal, only the steal attribute influences it. However, the price of the mission is influenced by all attributes. The higher the values, the higher the costs.

### Can I poison an army composed only of dark units?
By power you can, but dark units are immune to poison so you wouldn't kill any of them.

### What happens if we poison an army that has dark and normal units?
Only normal units are taken into account. Dark units are as if they didn't exist (not even for the calculation of the army size).

### What happens if we poison an army and all its units die?
The army disappears, and if it had samurai, the samurai takes his life.

### Do I have to pay all the money for the action when I send it?
Yes. However, if the ninja fails (whether he dies or not) in his task, half of the money invested will be returned to you.

## POLICIES

### How do assemblies work?

Assemblies serve to update the ranking. Depending on which assembly is activated, one ranking or another will be updated. Only one person can activate the same assembly at a time. In the case of regional assemblies, only one person from the same region can activate the assembly at a time. You cannot activate assemblies from regions other than your own.

The costs of the assemblies are variable and decrease over time:

Initial prices: Leader assembly: 50000 Clan assembly: 80000 Faction assembly: 40000 Sumo tournament: 50000 Regional leader assembly: 30000 Faction leader assembly: 35000 Regional faction assembly: 30000

In 2 days they all drop their price to 0, except that they cost at least 1000 gold. That is to say, in 48 hours its price is cancelled, so as an example with the Assembly of Leaders it drops to about 2000 gold/hour.

### How does the Sumo Tournament work?

To call a tournament you have to activate the "Sumo Tournament" policy. As with the assemblies, this policy can only be activated by one person at a time. Once activated, the tournament will be held, the winner will be proclaimed and the benefits will be distributed.

### Do the faction or minister bonuses affect all policies?

No. Special policies are not affected by any bonus. The case of "Iaijutsu duel" and "study terrain" is special, since they are affected by the reductions in time and cost but not by the reductions in effect.

### What resources do I recover if I cancel a policy before its activation time ends? And if I asked for imperial favors?

Half. In case you require Imperial Favors, you will get back half of the resources and all Imperial Favors.

### What about policies that are activated for a certain time? Can I activate them multiple times to increase their effect?

No. The policies "Emperor's Lands", "Imperial Manager" and "Imperial State" last for 5 days. If you cast them again before that time is up, you will increase their duration by 5 more days, but in no case will their effect be increased.

### Many policies say that they increase something by "at least" XX points. What makes it more?

A good policy minister increases the effect of political actions, which can make the points awarded more.

With "people power" you cannot attack but can you break free?

No. A break free is still an attack.

### What cases can occur with the "iajutsu duel"?

There are several cases that can occur: 1- No army has samurai. In this case the policy is not activated and the battle is normal. 2- Only one of them has samurai. In this case, the army that does not have samurai loses. There are no casualties and the action is spent. 3- Both have samurai. The duel takes place and the one who loses loses the battle. There are no casualties except the defeated samurai. In case of a tie, both samurai die and the battle is won by the defender.

If there are several armies on each side that have samurai, the best of them is chosen for the duel.

### How does the mentor work?

You choose two samurai and the first one will teach the skills he is a master of to the second. In the meantime, neither of the two samurai can be assigned and if one of them dies, the action will be cancelled. For each skill there will be a minimum of 80% chance that the apprentice will get the skill.

### You said the skills he is a master of. What does that mean?

A samurai is a master in the specialty in which he has the most skills. That is, if he has 5 economic skills, 3 general skills, and 7 subterfuge skills, that samurai will be a master in subterfuge, and therefore can only teach those skills with the mentor.

### What if he has the same number?

In case of a tie, the tie is broken as follows:

The order of preference (from highest to lowest) is as follows:

General Subterfuge Politics War Economy

Therefore, if he has 5 economics and 5 war, he will teach war skills.

## SAMURAI

### How does samurai training work?

A samurai can learn skills or improve his attributes. These are two different things. If you put a samurai to improve attributes, it will take him a certain amount of time to improve 1 point in the chosen characteristic. This time will be longer the higher his score in that characteristic. A samurai will continue training until he is told otherwise or reaches the maximum score allowed. This training has no cost. If you put a samurai to train a skill, he will take the time required by that skill to learn it. Once he has finished, he will continue training the characteristic associated with that skill until he is told otherwise or reaches the maximum score allowed. Training the skill has an associated cost, but the subsequent improvement of the corresponding attribute does not.

### Can a samurai learn multiple skills? And from different ministries?

Yes and yes, but the skills will only be activated when the samurai is in the corresponding ministry. Example: A samurai has both war and economic skills. If you put him as minister of war, only war skills will work, and if you put him in the minister of economy, only economic skills will work. If you put him in another position, none of them will work.

### What is the maximum value of each attribute for a samurai? Can I increase that value with policies like the "valet"?

'100. No. If you go over that value with the "valet" he will be as if he has 100.'

### Can I cancel a samurai's training? What if he is learning a skill?

Yes, but the resources you have paid for the skill are not recovered.

### If I cancel the training when he has 10 minutes left to go up a new point and then put him back in, will he still have those minutes left?

No. If you cancel, he loses the training he had at that point and would have to start over. Example: You put a samurai in training and it takes 45 minutes for him to gain a point. If you cancel when 13 minutes are left and then put him in training again, it will take 45 minutes for him to gain a point.

### Does a general affect all armies?

No, only the army he is in. It also does not affect associates.

### Can I teach an imperial expert new skills? And improve his stats?

Yes. An expert is no different from a normal samurai in these things.

## FACTIONS

### Can I change factions during a game?

There are two policies that allow you to do this: "Oath" and "Impersonate." The first is permanent and the second is temporary.

### Can I change factions between games?

Yes. When you join a game you always have the option to choose which faction you want to play as. The next game will be the same, so you can change if you want.

### Which faction is better?

There is no faction that is better than the others at everything. Snakes are very good at ninjutsu and dark. Dragons gather resources much better than the rest and their magic units are more durable. If you are looking for defense, Tigers are your choice and if you are looking for attack, Leopards will do a good job. Cranes collect much more gold from their villagers. And Ronin have the cheapest buildings of all and better ashigarus. As you can see, each faction is good at something and you can achieve great things with all of them.

### If I choose a faction, do I have to play the game for which it is intended?

No, but it is advisable to take advantage of the faction bonuses they have. You could go for ninjutsu as a dragon even if it is not as efficient. There is nothing stopping you.

## ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

### Can I have multiple accounts even if they don't interact?

No. It's a direct violation of Shogun's Return rules.

### What if I want to change my account name? Do I have to make a new one and delete the old one?

It's not necessary. When you start a new game, you're asked if you want to use the account name or not. You can enter another name there so that during that game you'll have another name.

### Phoenix is ​​very complicated. Isn't there a simpler explanation of how to avoid bans?

It basically boils down to "accounts that share an IP cannot interact in any way." Depending on the degree of interaction, the sanctions will be greater or lesser.

Phoenix is ​​automatic. I don't think that leaving ban decisions to an automatic system is a good thing.

Phoenix is ​​automatic and is a tool that serves as an aid to the person in charge of controlling multiple accounts. Behind the ban decisions there is always a person who looks at the cases that occur one by one. Decisions are not left to the system.

## OTHER

### How can I mark all forums as read without having to go through them one by one?

Simply click the "Mark all forums as read" link at the bottom right of the main page if you are using the "Shoguns" theme (the dark one). If you are using the light one, that link does not appear.

### If A has B as a subject and C has A as a subject, can B conquer C?

In this case B cannot conquer C since C is his ultimate lord (C->A->B) and if he were to conquer him, a circle would occur which would cause a chain error. Therefore, these types of attacks are not allowed.

### What is glory and what is it for? What is its limit?

It is an indicator of a player's worth in the different aspects of the game. It is earned by fighting battles, building buildings, spending resources, ninja missions, etc. and only decreases when you are conquered by another player (actually, being free gives you a 10% bonus to glory, so technically, glory never decreases, it just goes back to normal with no bonus when conquered). Your score can range from 0 to infinity. You start each game at 0, and the glory you earn in each game is accumulated to calculate your overall ranking and talent points. The more glory you have, the more talents you have to use when starting new games.

### What is honor and what is it for? What is its limit?

It is an indicator of how honorable you are as a leader of your city. It is gained in various ways, and can also be lost. It serves as a requirement for certain policies and units, as well as giving bonuses to population. The score can range from -100 to 100 (both inclusive). You start at 10.

### What happens if my honor falls below the policy and unit requirements?

You have a margin of 30 honor. If your honor drops 30 honor below the requirement for a policy, that policy will be cancelled. If the requirement is for a military unit, all units of that type you have will disappear. Example: You have 55 honor. You launch policy A which calls for 50 honor. If your honor drops below 20, policy A is cancelled.

### What are considered dark actions?

Anything that causes you to lose honor.
