# Build Menu

The Construction Menu is the second option in the **Basic Menus** dropdown.
From this menu, you can **construct buildings** in your settlement. The Construction Menu has only one submenu: Build.

## Build Submenu
This is the first and only submenu of the Construction Menu.

#### Settlement Overview
- A horizontal graphical map represents your entire settlement.
- At the top, there is a mini-map and arrow buttons to scroll left or right.
- Hovering over buildings displays their names.

Buildings appear in two different ways:
1. **Fully visible buildings** → You own at least one of these buildings.
2. **Semi-transparent buildings** → These haven’t been built yet.

#### How to Build Buildings?

Click on the building you want to construct. A **popup window** will appear, displaying the cost and description of the building. The popup also provides buttons for **Build** and **Destroy**:

   - **Build**:  
     When you issue a build order, it is added to the construction queue, which you can see above in **Active Constructions**.  
     However, to complete the construction, you must assign population to the construction task in the [Distribution Submenu](resources.md#distribution-submenu), found under the **Resources Menu**.
     - For [quantity-based buildings](../../game-concepts/buildings/index.md#types-of-buildings), you can specify the number of buildings to construct (or destroy).  
     - For [level-based buildings](../../game-concepts/buildings/index.md#types-of-buildings), there is only one button to build the next level.
   - **Destroy**:  
     When you destroy buildings or downgrade their levels, you lose the benefits they provide but regain the areas they occupied.

### Technology Tree *(in development)*
- In the top-left corner, there is a button to open the Technology Tree.
- The Technology Tree shows which buildings must be constructed to unlock different game menus.

### Ongoing Constructions
- Displays all **buildings currently under construction**.
- Each construction has a **progress bar** and a **countdown timer** showing time remaining
- From this section, you can **pause** constructions and **cancel** constructions **(refunds only 50% of the cost)**
- These details also appear in the [Resource Distribution submenu](resources.md#distribution-submenu) under the **Resources Menu**.

### Areas
- A graphical representation shows your land area distribution.
- Below, there is an option to purchase additional land in exchange for gold.
