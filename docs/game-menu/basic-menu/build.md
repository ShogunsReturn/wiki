# Build Menu

## Build Submenu
This is the first and only submenu under the Build menu.

<!-- ### Village Overview
A horizontal elongated graphic represents our entire village. At the top, we have a **minimap** and **arrows** to navigate left or right across the graphic. Hovering over the different buildings in the graphic displays their names.

On the graphic, you'll see two types of buildings:
- **Well-defined buildings**: These are the buildings you have already constructed at least one of.
- **Semi-transparent buildings**: These represent buildings that have not yet been constructed. -->

#### How to Build Buildings?

Click on the building you want to construct. A **popup window** will appear, displaying the cost and description of the building. The popup also provides buttons for **Build** and **Destroy**:

   - **Build**:  
     When you issue a build order, it is added to the construction queue, which you can see above in **Active Constructions**.  
     However, to complete the construction, you must assign population to the construction task in the [Distribution Submenu](resources.md#distribution-submenu), found under the **Resources Menu**.
     - For [quantity-based buildings](../../game-concepts/buildings/index.md#types-of-buildings), you can specify the number of buildings to construct (or destroy).  
     - For [level-based buildings](../../game-concepts/buildings/index.md#types-of-buildings), there is only one button to build the next level.

   - **Destroy** *(in development)*:  
     When you destroy buildings or downgrade their levels, you lose the benefits they provide but regain the areas they occupied.

### Technology Tree *(in development)*
Additionally, in this menu we can also see the technology tree by clicking on the button at the top right. The technology tree is a graph that indicates the buildings that we must build to unlock each of the game's menus.

### Constructions in progress
Shows all the constructions that are currently being carried out. A progress bar and the time remaining until the construction is completed are shown for each construction. From here we can pause and cancel constructions. (When canceling a construction we only recover half of its cost). This same data appears in the [distribution submenu](resources.md#distribution-submenu), within the Resources Menu.

### Areas *(in development)*
Shows a graph with the distribution of Areas.

Below we have the option to buy additional areas in exchange for gold.
