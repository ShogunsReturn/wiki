# Resources Menu

The build menu is the **first option** we find when displaying the **Basic Menus**.

From this menu we can manage all aspects of the game related to Resources and Population. The build menu has **four submenus**:
- Distribution
- Management
- Hierarchy
- Favors *(in development)*

## Distribution Submenu
It is the **first submenu** of the resources menu.

### Task Distribution
At the top is the Task Distribution. It consists of five action areas that represent the five tasks to which our population can be assigned. These tasks are:

- Rice harvesting
- Meat harvesting
- Wood harvesting
- Iron harvesting
- Construction *(and crafts - in development)*

#### How to assign the population to the different tasks?
By clicking in the icon of each resource inside the task distribution section, then the villagers' assignment modal will appear. This window contains 2 fields; the first one is where you assign the villagers' quantity to be added to the selected task, and the second one is used to select the task from which you want to reduce the villagers' quantity to be moved to the desired task. Also, you will find the "max" button to type the maximum villagers that can be assigned to the selected task, but if the villagers' quantity to remove from the other task is less than the maximum, it will type this quantity instead.
:::info Example
1. You have 100 assigned villagers of a maximum of 200 in the rice task and 300 villagers in the construction task. When you click the "max" button, 100 will be typed in the text field.
2. You have 100 assigned villagers of a maximum of 200 in the rice task and 50 villagers in the construction task. When you click the "max" button, 50 will be typed in the text field.
:::
<!-- There are two ways to distribute the population.

1. By dragging the villager-shaped icons between the action areas. There are a total of 20 villager-shaped icons (male and female), each of them representing 5% of the total population. We must click and hold drag to the area where we want to distribute those villagers.

2. By clicking on the top of each of the action areas. A quick villager assignment pop-up window will appear. This window has three buttons: Assign all population that can work on this task, Assign half of the population, and Remove all population. In addition to these three buttons, there is a text area where you can enter the percentage of the population you want to assign precisely. When using this method of assignment, the “Construction” action area acts as a “buffer.” This means that when you remove villagers from any of the tasks, those villagers will go to “construction,” and when you add villagers, they will also be taken from the “construction” area. If there are no villagers under construction, you will not be able to assign more to the new task this way. -->

<!-- :::tip
The second method of population distribution is much more precise, since you can adjust the number of villagers assigned to each task (sometimes there is a 1-villager offset due to internal percentage calculations).
::: -->

### Detail View
In the central part of the distribution submenu we find the detail view, where the following information is displayed:

The **first column** indicates the **number of workers** in the task and the **maximum number of workers** that can be effective in that task. <!-- If we assign a number of workers greater than the maximum, the number will appear in red and those workers will not be effective in that task. --> The population limit for each resource is different. For the collection of rice, meat and iron it is indicated by the number of fields, farms and mines respectively. For the collection of wood it is indicated by the size of the forest, while for construction it is the only task that does not have a limitation of workers.

The **second column** indicates the **percentage** of population assigned.

The **third column** indicates the **income** that we are obtaining from each of the resources through our workers. Remember that there are other methods of acquiring resources, such as expanding the port, which will not be included here. For construction, the number of unfinished buildings or "tasks" is indicated in this column.

The **fourth column** indicates the **storage limit** of the resources. The storage limit can be increased by leveling up the **warehouse** building.

The **fifth column** provides some additional information: the **meat balance** and the **forest recovery**. For construction, this column displays a button you can click to see a detailed view of the **ongoing constructions**. From here, you can pause or cancel these constructions.

### Available Workers
Finally at the bottom of the submenu we find a summary of the workers we currently have. Men, women, ashiheis and seasonal workers. Remember that ashiheis work like villagers and seasonal workers, except for crafting.

## Management Submenu
This is the **second submenu** of the resources menu.

This submenu provides detailed information about all aspects of the game that affect **income** and **expenses** (e.g., maintenance costs, taxes) for your resources and population, as well as any special events influencing them.

It has 6 tabs that show the following information:

- **Gold:** Actions or events that impact your income and expenses related to gold.
- **Food:** Actions or events affecting your income and expenses of **rice** and **meat**.
- **Wood:** Actions or events influencing your income of wood and the state of your **forest areas**.
- **Iron:** Actions or events impacting your income and expenses of iron.
- **Population:** Actions or events affecting the **growth or decline of your population**, as well as construction-related aspects.
- **Glory and honor:** Actions or events affecting the **increase or decrease of honor and glory**.  

## Hierarchy Submenu
This is the **third submenu** in the resources menu.

### Current Lord
This shows information about our current lord: the taxes he currently imposes on us and the total amount of resources he takes from us.

:::tip
In Shogun's Return you can be conquered by other players. When you are conquered, the other player becomes your lord and has the possibility of imposing a tax rate of 0% to 25% of the resources you generate (by default the tax is automatically set to 15% when conquered). At the start of the game, all players are vassals of an NPC named Takeshi. This lord imposes a tax rate of 25% by default. If a player imposes taxes higher than 15% on another player, he will begin to lose honor.
:::

### Vassals
From here you can adjust the taxes you want to impose on each of your vassals and view the amount of resources you get from them. You can also activate the option for the ashihei you have in your province to help your vassal as workers. In addition, from this menu you can see the % of the glory gained from your vassals that will be directed to you ("Vassal Glory").

:::tip
By attacking other players you can conquer them and make them your vassals, on whom you can impose taxes. To keep a player as a vassal you must maintain an army of your own or an ally in his province. However, if you ever have a glory higher than three times that of the vassal, he will be automatically released.
:::

## Favors Submenu *(in development)*
This is the **fourth submenu** of the resources menu.

It shows you information on how to obtain the most valuable resource in the game, Imperial Favors. Imperial Favors are obtained as you accumulate glory, and you can also obtain them by holding assemblies (political action) or by purchasing them.
