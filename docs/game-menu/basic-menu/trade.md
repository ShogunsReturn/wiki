# Trade Menu *(in development)*

The trade menu is the **third option** found when displaying the Basic Menus.

:::note
The trade menu is locked at the start of the game, to unlock it you must build the [Market](/docs/game-concepts/buildings/commercial-political/market).
:::

From the trade menu you can view and manage all aspects related to the purchase, sale and shipment of resources, as well as order the creation of crafted objects. The trade menu has 4 submenus: Buy, Sell, Ship and Craft.

## Buy submenu
This is the first submenu of the trade menu. <!--You can access it by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “1” hotkey. -->

From the buy submenu we can view all the offers in play, made by other players or by NPCs. The upper part “Search Offers”, contains a series of filters to change the search criteria for offers.

The filters that we can modify when doing the search are:

- **Filter (give):** We select the resource or resources that we want to buy.
- **Filter (ask):** We select the resource or resources that the offerer asks for in exchange.
- **Order offers:** We have 3 options to order the offers in the list, by their ratio, by the amount offered or by cost.

:::info Example
There are 2 offers in the market in which they offer iron for gold. Offer A sells 100 iron for 200 gold (ratio 0.50), while offer B sells 300 iron for 400 gold (ratio 0.75). When ordering the offers by ratio, offer B will appear before offer A, since its ratio is more profitable.

### Manageable Quantity

At the top we also find a bar that indicates the amount of manageable resources per day. The amount of resources that we can manage is measured in "sacks". A unit of food occupies 1 sack; a unit of gold 2 sacks; a unit of wood occupies 3 sacks and finally, a unit of iron occupies 4 sacks. Thus, 600 units of food occupy the same sacks as 300 units of gold, 200 units of wood or 150 units of iron.

Every time you receive resources, the corresponding sacks will be subtracted from the amount of manageable sacks. Making shipments will increase the amount of manageable sacks available, in the number of bags that corresponds to the resource sent.

Also, the manageable amount is double what you can send. To increase the amount of manageable bags we must increase the market level.

### Available Offers

At the bottom, the list of available offers will appear according to the filters set in the search. For each offer we have the following information: quantity and type of resource they sell, quantity and type of resource they ask in exchange, player making the offer, time to make the exchange.

#### How to search and accept offers?

1. First, we must select the search filters and press the reload button.

2. At the bottom, the available offers will appear listed depending on our search criteria.

3. To the right of each offer, a button appears to accept said offer. Once accepted, it cannot be cancelled.

4. We must wait for the exchange to be made. The time will depend on the distance at which the players making the exchange are, but it is less time than the displacement of ninjas or armies.

## Sell ​​Submenu
This is the **second submenu** of the trade menu. 
<!-- You can access it by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “2” hotkey. -->

From the sell submenu you can make your own offers, which will appear in the list of offers for the rest of the players. At the top there are two selectors where you can select the type and quantity of resource you want to sell and the type and quantity of resource you want to get in exchange. When you make an offer you will have to pay an amount of gold, which will be lower as you increase the market level.

At the bottom you can see your own offers in the market. On the right there is a button to cancel the offer.

All the resources offered count as if they were in the warehouse, that is, they cannot be used to pay for buildings or recruits but they will count towards the maximum storage or they can even be stolen by enemy ninjas.

### Merchants

Merchants limit the number of exchanges (purchases, sales and shipments) of resources that you can make simultaneously. For every two market levels you get a new merchant.

## Send Submenu
This is the **third submenu** of the trade menu. 
<!-- It can be accessed by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “3” hotkey. -->

From the send submenu we can send resources to other allied players.

At the top we select the type and quantity of resource we want to send and in the text field we must write the nickname of the player we want to send the resource to. When sending a resource we must pay an amount of gold that will be less as we increase the level of the market.

<!-- ## Craft Submenu
This is the fourth submenu of the trade menu. It can be accessed by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “4” hotkey. The craft submenu will be locked until we build the market to level 3.

From the craft submenu we can order the creation of crafted items.

At the top we select the crafted item we want to make. At the bottom we will be given details of the item, its costs and the benefits it brings us. There is also a text box where you can select the number of items you want to craft.

Crafted items you order will be added to the list of buildings under construction. To make crafted items, you need to assign population to the construction task. At first, you'll start by making level 1 crafted items, but as you level up certain buildings, you'll make higher-level and better crafted items. -->
