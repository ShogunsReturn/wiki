# Basic Menu

Basic Menus is the first option in the Game Menu.

The Basic Menus drop-down menu contains the main game options for managing your province and your resources.

Within Basic Menus we display the following options:

- [Resources Menu](resources.md)
- [Build Menu](build.md)
- Trade Menu *(in development)*

When you start the game, the Resources Menu and the Build Menu appear **unlocked**, while the Trade Menu appears **blocked** until you build the [market](../../game-concepts/buildings/commercial-political/market.md).
