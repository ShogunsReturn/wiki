# Armies Menu

The Army menu is the first option we find when displaying the Advanced Menus. <!-- This menu can also be accessed by pressing the “E” hotkey. --> 

:::note
The Army menu is locked at the start of the game, to unlock it we must build the [dojo](../../game-concepts/buildings/military/dojo.md).
:::

From the Armies Menu, you can view and manage all aspects related to military units and armies. 
The Army menu has **4 submenus**: 
1. **Recruit**
2. **Armies**
3. **Strategy**
4. **Effects** *(in development)*

## Recruit Submenu
This is the first submenu of the armies menu. <!-- You can access it by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “1” hotkey. -->

From this submenu you can recruit military units to join your troop reserve.

### How to recruit units?

<!-- 1. At the top there are four tabs that allow you to select unit classes: basic, magic, dark and special. -->

1. Click on the unit icons to select the unit you want to recruit.
2. Once selected, you will see the unit's image, description, attributes, cost, maintenance, and requirements to level up.
3. At the bottom, enter the number of units you wish to recruit and click "Recruit".

:::tip
- You must have enough resources to pay for recruitment costs and sufficient income to cover maintenance costs.
- Recruitment slots are required, which depend on the Dojo and Temple levels.
- Increasing the level of these buildings allows you to recruit more units.
:::

:::info
You can recruit any number of units at once, and the recruitment time remains the same whether recruiting 10 or 1,000 units.
:::

### How to level up your units?

- Each unit requires one or more buildings for recruitment.
- By upgrading these buildings, you can recruit higher-level units.
- Higher-level units have better attributes while maintaining the same cost and upkeep.

## Armies submenu
This is the second submenu of the armies menu. <!-- It can be accessed by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “2” hotkey. -->

Here, you can create, manage, and organize your armies. At the top of the menu, you will see:
- Reserve Units (your available units).
- Rescind Area (where you can remove units).

Below, you will find "New Army" section, where you can:
- Assign a Samurai General (optional).
- Add up to 6 unit types.

### How to create an army?

1. **Drag units from the Reserve** into one of the **six unit slots**.
2. An army **must contain at least one unit**.
3. **Each slot can only hold one type of unit** (but in unlimited quantity).
4. You can optionally assign a Samurai as a General:
    - The Samurai **grants powerful bonuses**.
    - The Samurai must be in the ["Hidden" state](../../game-concepts/samurais/samurais.md#samurai-states) to be assigned.
    - Click the button next to the portrait area to assign the Samurai.
5. Give the army a name and click **"Create"**.

At the bottom of the menu, you will see a list of all armies in the same province.

<!-- 💡 Unit Management Tips:
Move units between armies by dragging unit icons.
Use the drop-down menu to select different provinces where you have armies. -->

### How to delete units?

Drag unit icons to the "Rescind" area.

### How to delete an army?

You just need to identify the army to be deleted and click in rescind army button.

<!-- Armies already created have an icon with two spears to the left of the samurai portrait. By dragging this icon to the rescind area we can delete the army. The units will be eliminated and our general (if there was one) will become a samurai in a “hidden” state. -->

<!-- ### How to merge two armies?

To merge two armies we must drag the icon with two spears from one of them to the area that delimits the other. To merge two armies we must keep in mind that we can only have a total of 6 different units in the same army, otherwise we will not be able to merge them. If the two armies we want to merge have a general, the one in the army we are dragging will become a samurai in a “hidden” state.

:::tip
At the bottom there is a selector to divide or not divide the units when assigning them. If we deactivate this option every time we drag a unit icon a pop-up window will allow us to select the number of units we want to move. With this option activated we will always drag all the units and this pop-up window will not appear.
::: -->

### How to update army priority?
To the right of the unit slots we have a button to change the [priority status](../../game-concepts/armies#army-priorities) of the army.

- **Priority to Defend**: The army will defend the province it is stationed in. It will assist in defending the lord who is collecting taxes.  
- **Priority Not to Defend**: The army will avoid engaging in combat. This option has no effect if the army is collecting taxes.  

## Strategy Submenu
This is the third submenu of the armies menu. <!-- You can access it by clicking on the icon or by pressing the hotkey “3”. -->

<!-- From this submenu we can give strategic orders to our armies. The strategy menu has 4 tabs:-->
This submenu allows you to give strategic orders to your armies. There are two [types of attacks](../../game-concepts/military-strategy.md#attack) you can perform:

- **Liberation**: This is an attack against your lord's army occupying your province. If you succeed in liberating your province, they will no longer collect taxes from you.
- **Attack Target Province**: This is an attack on another player's province. If you succeed, they will become your vassal, and you can collect taxes from them as long as your army remains stationed there.

<!-- - **Status:** In this tab we can see the status of all our armies and the armies of other players who are in our province (such as our lord's or a player who is attacking us).
- **Move:** In this tab we can select our armies and move them from one province to another. Remember that you can only move your armies to your province, the province of your subjects, the provinces of allies and clan members or those of their subjects. To move an army we must select it from the drop-down menu and then write the name of the player whose province we want to move to.
- **Attack:** From this tab we can order attacks with our armies. The two types of attack that we can carry out are:
    - **Liberation:** this is an attack on the army of your lord that occupies your province. If you manage to free yourself, he will stop charging you taxes.
    - **Attack target province:** this is an attack on another player's province. If we manage to win, he will become our subject and we will be able to charge him taxes as long as our army remains there.
- **Associate:** In this tab we can associate our armies with those of an ally or member of our clan. To do this we must select the army we wish to associate and then the army we want to associate with. Finally, we press the “Associate” button. To associate two armies, it is necessary that both are in the same province. -->

## Effects submenu *(in development)*
This is the fifth submenu of the armies menu. <!-- It can be accessed by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “4” hotkey. -->

This submenu shows us detailed information about all aspects of the game that influence the behavior of our armies and units.
