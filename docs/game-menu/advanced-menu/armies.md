# Armies Menu

The Army menu is the first option we find when displaying the Advanced Menus. <!-- This menu can also be accessed by pressing the “E” hotkey. --> 

:::note
The Army menu is locked at the start of the game, to unlock it we must build the [dojo](../../game-concepts/buildings/military/dojo.md).
:::

From the Army menu we can view and manage all aspects related to military units and armies. The Army menu has **4 submenus**: 
- Recruit
- Armies
- Strategy
- Effects *(in development)*

## Recruit Submenu
This is the first submenu of the armies menu. <!-- You can access it by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “1” hotkey. -->

From this submenu you can recruit military units to join your troop reserve.

### How to recruit units?

<!-- 1. At the top there are four tabs that allow you to select unit classes: basic, magic, dark and special. -->

1. By clicking on the icons at the top you select the desired unit.

2. When you select a unit you see its image, description, attributes, cost, maintenance and the requirements necessary for it to level up.

3. Finally, at the bottom you must enter the number of units you want to recruit in the text field and press the “recruit” button.

:::tip
You must keep in mind that in order to recruit units you need to have enough resources to pay their cost, and later, you must have enough income to be able to pay for their maintenance. We will also need to have recruiting positions. There are units that are recruited through the dojo and others through the temple. We will need to level up these buildings to increase the recruitment slots.
:::

:::info
We can recruit all the units of the same type that we want at once. The recruitment time remains the same, whether you are recruiting 10 units or 1000 units.
:::

### How to level up our units?

Each unit depends on one or more buildings to be able to be recruited. As we increase the level of these buildings, the units that we can recruit will have a higher level each time. The higher the level, the better the attributes of our units, but their cost and maintenance remains the same.

## Armies submenu
This is the second submenu of the armies menu. <!-- It can be accessed by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “2” hotkey. -->

From this submenu we can create armies and manage armies that we have already created. At the top of the menu we find the **Units in Reserve** section and the **rescind unit** button. Below we find another area: **create a new army**<!-- , which is made up of a box where we can include a samurai to lead the army and another 6 boxes where we can include military units. --> where you can assign the army name, the initial unit with its respective quantity to have a new army. Also you will see the cost and maintenance of each army.

### How to create an army?

All the units that we have recruited from the recruit submenu appear in our unit reserve.
To create an army we just need to fill the army name, select a unit and the quantity and click in create new army button
<!-- From the reserve we must drag the icons that represent the units to one of the six unit boxes. -->
<!-- An army must have at least one of the six unit boxes full. -->
Each box can hold an unlimited number of units but always of the same type.

<!-- Optionally, we can add a samurai as a general of the army. Generals can be decisive by giving many advantages to our armies, as well as being a very powerful unit in themselves. To add a general we must have a samurai in “hidden” state and click on the button to the left of the portrait. -->

<!-- Finally we must give a name to our army and press the “create” button.
At the bottom of the menu we find a list of the armies we have in the same province. In the same way that we drag units between the “reserve” and “new army” slots, we can also move units between armies that are in the same place. At the top we have a drop-down menu that shows us the different places where we have our armies. -->

### How to delete units?

<!-- To delete units we must drag the unit icons to the rescind area. -->
To delete units you must have them in reserve, then click in rescind unit button where you will need to select the unit and the quantity to be deleted.

### How to delete an army?

You just need to identify the army to be deleted and click in rescind army button.

<!-- Armies already created have an icon with two spears to the left of the samurai portrait. By dragging this icon to the rescind area we can delete the army. The units will be eliminated and our general (if there was one) will become a samurai in a “hidden” state. -->

<!-- ### How to merge two armies?

To merge two armies we must drag the icon with two spears from one of them to the area that delimits the other. To merge two armies we must keep in mind that we can only have a total of 6 different units in the same army, otherwise we will not be able to merge them. If the two armies we want to merge have a general, the one in the army we are dragging will become a samurai in a “hidden” state.

:::tip
At the bottom there is a selector to divide or not divide the units when assigning them. If we deactivate this option every time we drag a unit icon a pop-up window will allow us to select the number of units we want to move. With this option activated we will always drag all the units and this pop-up window will not appear.
::: -->

### How to update army priority?
To the right of the unit slots we have a button to change the [priority status](../../game-concepts/armies#army-priorities) of the army.

- **Priority to Defend**: The army will defend the province it is stationed in. It will assist in defending the lord who is collecting taxes.  
- **Priority Not to Defend**: The army will avoid engaging in combat. This option has no effect if the army is collecting taxes.  

## Strategy Submenu
This is the third submenu of the armies menu. <!-- You can access it by clicking on the icon or by pressing the hotkey “3”. -->

<!-- From this submenu we can give strategic orders to our armies. The strategy menu has 4 tabs:-->
This submenu allows you to give strategic orders to your armies. There are two [types of attacks](../../game-concepts/military-strategy.md#attack) you can perform:

- **Liberation**: This is an attack against your lord's army occupying your province. If you succeed in liberating your province, they will no longer collect taxes from you.
- **Attack Target Province**: This is an attack on another player's province. If you succeed, they will become your vassal, and you can collect taxes from them as long as your army remains stationed there.

<!-- - **Status:** In this tab we can see the status of all our armies and the armies of other players who are in our province (such as our lord's or a player who is attacking us).
- **Move:** In this tab we can select our armies and move them from one province to another. Remember that you can only move your armies to your province, the province of your subjects, the provinces of allies and clan members or those of their subjects. To move an army we must select it from the drop-down menu and then write the name of the player whose province we want to move to.
- **Attack:** From this tab we can order attacks with our armies. The two types of attack that we can carry out are:
    - **Liberation:** this is an attack on the army of your lord that occupies your province. If you manage to free yourself, he will stop charging you taxes.
    - **Attack target province:** this is an attack on another player's province. If we manage to win, he will become our subject and we will be able to charge him taxes as long as our army remains there.
- **Associate:** In this tab we can associate our armies with those of an ally or member of our clan. To do this we must select the army we wish to associate and then the army we want to associate with. Finally, we press the “Associate” button. To associate two armies, it is necessary that both are in the same province. -->

## Effects submenu *(in development)*
This is the fifth submenu of the armies menu. <!-- It can be accessed by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “4” hotkey. -->

This submenu shows us detailed information about all aspects of the game that influence the behavior of our armies and units.
