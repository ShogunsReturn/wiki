# Advanced Menu

Advanced Menus is the second option in the Game Menu.

In the Advanced Menus drop-down menu you will find the more complex game menus, which are unlocked in advanced stages of the game.

Within Advanced Menus we display the following options:

- [Army Menu](./armies.md)
- Ninjutsu Menu *(in development)*
- [Politics Menu](./politics.md)
- [Samurai Menu](./samurais.md)
- Betting Menu *(in development)*

When starting the game all advanced menus appear locked. They will be unlocked as the Buildings required to access each menu are built. If you click on them while they are locked you will be able to see the building they require.
