# Map Menu

The map menu is the first and only option we find when displaying the Display Menus.<!--  This menu can also be accessed by using the “A” hotkey. -->

From the map menu we obtain information about our situation in the world of Shogun’s Return.

The map menu has a single submenu: Map.

## Map Submenu
This is the first and only submenu of the map menu.

From this submenu we can see our position on the Shogun’s Return world map. At the top of the map we find the following buttons:

<!-- 4 buttons to select the type of map -->
- Zoom in
- Zoom out
- Move left
- Move right
- Move up
- Move down
- Reset view
- Filter players
<!-- a text field to search for a player by their nickname

Button to Show/Hide extra elements: By activating this option we can see the position of our armies, ninjas and merchants on the map.
By clicking on a player’s name on the map, information about the player and a series of quick links to interact with the user appear under the navigation controls. -->

### General map
This type of map is displayed by default. We see our position in the world and the leaders of each region. The color of each region is painted with the color of the faction of the player who leads it. In this type of map, the navigation controls are disabled.

### Political map
Our position is displayed with a zoom closer to that of the general map. We can adjust the zoom level and navigate the map with the controls. In this type of map we see the position of the other players in the game. For each player we can see:

Recognized/unrecognized: If he is recognized, he will have the symbol of a castle, otherwise he will have the symbol of a house.
Faction: Next to his castle he has a flag of his faction.
Difficulty: His amount of glory compared to ours. In front of his name there is a circle that has the following meaning:
Grey circle: His glory is much less than ours
Green circle: His glory is less than ours.
Yellow circle: His glory is similar to ours
Red circle: His glory is much higher than ours.
On this map the provinces of our direct subjects (orange), indirect subjects (yellow) and lord (red) are marked.

### Show Allies
The map is displayed similarly to the political map, but the provinces of allies (green), clan members (yellow), and enemies (red) are marked.

### Show Hierarchies
The map is displayed similarly to the political map, but the provinces are colored with the color of the lord in the chain of command that controls it. -->
