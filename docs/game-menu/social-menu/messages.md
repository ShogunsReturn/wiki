# Messages Menu

The messages menu is the first option we find when displaying the Social Menus.

From the messages menu we can read the messages sent to us by advisors or other players, and we can write messages to other players.

The messages menu has 3 submenus: Inbox, Sent and Write. If you are part of a clan, it has a fourth submenu: Write a message to the clan.

## Inbox submenu
This is the first submenu of the messages menu. <!-- It can be accessed by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “1” hotkey. -->

From this submenu we can read the messages sent to us by the game or by other players. At the top we can filter the categories of messages we want to view. At the bottom we will see the messages we have from the filtered category.

### How to read a message?

To read a message we must click on the “display” button, which is to the right of each message.

### How to delete a message?

To delete a message, click on the “delete” button, which is on the right of each message. You can also delete all the messages in the selected category by clicking on the “delete category” button at the top. When you have more than 50 messages.<!-- , they are automatically deleted after two days. -->

<!-- ### Other options in the messages menu:

- Compact for forum: a pop-up window will appear with the message text ready to be entered into the forum.
- Mark as offensive message: When the message was sent by another player, you can mark it as offensive if it has content that you consider inappropriate according to the rules of the game. The message will be reviewed by the administrators.
- Reply to message: When the message was sent by another player, you can reply directly by clicking on the “write reply” button on the right.
- Reply to clan: When the message was sent by a player from your clan, you can reply to the entire clan by clicking on the “write reply to clan” button on the right. -->

## Sent Submenu *(in development)*
This is the second submenu of the messages menu. <!-- It can be accessed by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “2” hotkey. -->

This submenu saves the messages you have sent to other players. <!-- If you have more than 20 messages sent, they will be automatically deleted after two days. -->

## Write Submenu *(in development)*
This is the third submenu of the messages menu. <!-- It can be accessed by clicking on the icon or by pressing the “3” hotkey.-->

From this submenu we can write messages to other players. The menu has three text fields: in the first we must write the Nick of the player to whom we want to send the message, in the second field we must write the subject and in the third the content of the message.

Sending a message has a small gold cost to avoid spam.
