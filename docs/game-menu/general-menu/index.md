# General Menu

General Menus is the fifth option in the Game Menu.

Within General Menus we display the following options:

- [Rankings Menu](./rankings.md)
- Manual: link to the Shogun's Return wiki homepage.
- Logout: Button that logs us out and takes us to the Account Manager.

When starting the game all the options in the General Menu appear unlocked.
